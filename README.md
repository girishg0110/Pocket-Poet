# Pocket Poet
Here, I'll document my successive attempts at natural language processing. The initial idea for this repository was to build a Markov Chain model for text generation, 
integrating some basic networking (webscraping famous literary texts from free online resources) with data structures implementation for use in a course I teach as part of 
Rutgers IEEE. Adaptations of the HashMap and the AVL tree were implemented for demonstrational purposes.

On the future: I will toy with some basic n-gram logistic regression, leading into applying LSTM architecture on this NLP task.
